# Security Policy

The detail security policy [Minato Namikaze](https://github.com/The-4th-Hokage/yondaime-hokage)

## Supported Versions

Versions of the project which are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| <= 1.1  | :x:                |


At any given time, we provide official security support for a single version the bot only:


The main development branch, hosted on GitHub, which will become the next major release of bot, receives security support. Security issues that only affect the main development branch and not any stable released versions are fixed in public without going through the disclosure process.
Long-term support releases will receive security updates for a specified period.
When new releases are issued for security reasons, the accompanying notice will include a list of affected versions. This list is comprised solely of supported versions of Djathe botngo: older versions may also be affected, but we do not investigate to determine that, and will not issue patches or new releases for those versions.
