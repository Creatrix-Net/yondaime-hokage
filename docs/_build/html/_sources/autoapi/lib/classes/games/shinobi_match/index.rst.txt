.. py:class:: CharacterSelect(characters)

   Bases: :py:obj:`discord.ui.Select`\ [\ :py:obj:`ShinobiMatchCharacterSelection`\ ]

   Represents a UI select menu.

   This is usually represented as a drop down menu.

   In order to get the selected items that the user has chosen, use :attr:`Select.values`.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   :param custom_id: The ID of the select menu that gets received during an interaction.
                     If not given then one is generated for you.
   :type custom_id: :class:`str`
   :param placeholder: The placeholder text that is shown if nothing is selected, if any.
   :type placeholder: Optional[:class:`str`]
   :param min_values: The minimum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
                      Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
   :type min_values: :class:`int`
   :param max_values: The maximum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
                      Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
   :type max_values: :class:`int`
   :param options: A list of options that can be selected in this menu.
   :type options: List[:class:`discord.SelectOption`]
   :param disabled: Whether the select is disabled or not.
   :type disabled: :class:`bool`
   :param row: The relative row this select menu belongs to. A Discord component can only have 5
               rows. By default, items are arranged automatically into those 5 rows. If you'd
               like to control the relative positioning of the row then passing an index is advised.
               For example, row=1 will show up before row=2. Defaults to ``None``, which is automatic
               ordering. The row number must be between 0 and 4 (i.e. zero indexed).
   :type row: Optional[:class:`int`]

   .. py:method:: __fill_options(self)


   .. py:method:: callback(self, interaction)
      :async:

      |coro|

      The callback associated with this UI item.

      This can be overridden by subclasses.

      :param interaction: The interaction that triggered this UI item.
      :type interaction: :class:`.Interaction`



.. py:class:: ShinobiMatchCharacterSelection(characters_data, ctx, player, message = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`discord.ui.View`

   Represents a UI view.

   This object must be inherited to create a UI within Discord.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   :param timeout: Timeout in seconds from last interaction with the UI before no longer accepting input.
                   If ``None`` then there is no timeout.
   :type timeout: Optional[:class:`float`]

   .. py:attribute:: children
      :annotation: :List[Union[CharacterSelect, discord.Button, discord.ui.Button]]

      

   .. py:method:: get_character_config(self, character_id)


   .. py:method:: select(self, button, interaction)
      :async:


   .. py:method:: cancel(self, button, interaction)
      :async:


   .. py:method:: interaction_check(self, interaction)
      :async:

      |coro|

      A callback that is called when an interaction happens within the view
      that checks whether the view should process item callbacks for the interaction.

      This is useful to override if, for example, you want to ensure that the
      interaction author is a given user.

      The default implementation of this returns ``True``.

      .. note::

          If an exception occurs within the body then the check
          is considered a failure and :meth:`on_error` is called.

      :param interaction: The interaction that occurred.
      :type interaction: :class:`~discord.Interaction`

      :returns: Whether the view children's callbacks should be called.
      :rtype: :class:`bool`


   .. py:method:: on_timeout(self)
      :async:

      |coro|

      A callback that is called when a view's timeout elapses without being explicitly stopped.



.. py:class:: MatchHandlerViewButton(label)

   Bases: :py:obj:`discord.ui.Button`\ [\ :py:obj:`MatchHandlerView`\ ]

   Represents a UI button.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   :param style: The style of the button.
   :type style: :class:`discord.ButtonStyle`
   :param custom_id: The ID of the button that gets received during an interaction.
                     If this button is for a URL, it does not have a custom ID.
   :type custom_id: Optional[:class:`str`]
   :param url: The URL this button sends you to.
   :type url: Optional[:class:`str`]
   :param disabled: Whether the button is disabled or not.
   :type disabled: :class:`bool`
   :param label: The label of the button, if any.
   :type label: Optional[:class:`str`]
   :param emoji: The emoji of the button, if available.
   :type emoji: Optional[Union[:class:`.PartialEmoji`, :class:`.Emoji`, :class:`str`]]
   :param row: The relative row this button belongs to. A Discord component can only have 5
               rows. By default, items are arranged automatically into those 5 rows. If you'd
               like to control the relative positioning of the row then passing an index is advised.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   :param timeout: Timeout in seconds from last interaction with the UI before no longer accepting input.
